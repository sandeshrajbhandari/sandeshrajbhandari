### Hi there 

I'm Sandesh from Australia, and I do website development for businesses and firms. I really enjoy learning new programming paradigms and frameworks like React and Next.js. I also have experience in using Wordpress to launch managed websites with good SEO.

I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux, and design in general. You can check out my twitter at [twitter.com/sandeshrajx](twitter.com/sandeshrajx)
